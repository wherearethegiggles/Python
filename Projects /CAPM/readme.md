CAPM Application using Streamlit

The capital asset pricing model - or CAPM - is a financial model that calculates the expected rate of return for an asset or investment. CAPM does this by using the expected return on both the market and a risk-free asset, and the asset's correlation or sensitivity to the market (beta).
